# Hosting-Capacity

Includes Julai scripts to evaluate Hosting Capacity:
1) with only Demand Response Flexibility (HC_with_flex.jl).
2) with both Demand Response and DG Curtailment (HC_with_flex_curt.jl).
3) with no flexibility (HC.jl).

Additionally, we have a script for the sensitivity of the HC: Sensitivity_no_flex.jl, Sensitivity.jl

Test.jl allows to save data in a xlsx file.
